# ofxEmotiBit
Software code for the EmotiBit. 
If you just want to visualize and parse data from the EmotiBit (for Windows/ macOS), you can simply download the software directly in [releases](https://github.com/EmotiBit/ofxEmotiBit/releases).

If you want to modify the code(or build the tools in Linux), below are the requirements to build the project.  

## Requirements
- OF 11 ~~https://openframeworks.cc/download/~~ NOTE: ofxEmotiBit is not yet compatible with 0.11.2. OF v0.11.0 can be downloaded here https://openframeworks.cc/versions/v0.11.0/
### The following addons should be placed inside the OpenFrameworks addons folder:
#### Note: If downloading zip instead of `git clone` be sure to remove `-master` from the folder name to avoid path discrepancies
- ofxNetworkUtils - https://github.com/bakercp/ofxNetworkUtils
- ofxOscilloscope - https://github.com/produceconsumerobot/ofxOscilloscope
- ofxThreadedLogger - https://github.com/produceconsumerobot/ofxThreadedLogger
- ofxBiquadFilter - https://github.com/mrbichel/ofxBiquadFilter
- ofxJSON - https://github.com/jeffcrouse/ofxJSON
- EmotiBit_XPlat_Utils - https://github.com/EmotiBit/EmotiBit_XPlat_Utils
- ofxLSL - https://github.com/EmotiBit/ofxLSL
  - _**Note:**_ for lsl support, if developing with visual studio, code should be compiled for x64
  - liblsl64.dll should always be in the same folder as the .exe (i.e. EmotiBitOscilloscope/bin/liblsl64.dll)
  - liblsl64.lib should always be linked to in under _solution properties->linker->general->additional library directories_ and _solution properties->linker->input-> additional dependencies_
  - both of these libs are handled properly by default, but should be considered if deviating from release code
- The project is built on a 64-bit architecture. Make sure you are on a machine that support `x64` build platform.
- Required to build EmotiBit FirmwareInstaller
  - ofxSerial - https://github.com/EmotiBit/ofxSerial
  - ofxIO - https://github.com/bakercp/ofxIO

#### The following script may be run from a bash shell within your openFrameworks/addons/ directory to install ofxEmotiBit and all dependencies. 
_**Note:**_ this requires you to have [github SSH key access set up](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).
```
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
git clone git@github.com:EmotiBit/ofxEmotiBit.git
git clone git@github.com:bakercp/ofxNetworkUtils.git
cd ofxNetworkUtils
git checkout stable
cd ..
git clone git@github.com:produceconsumerobot/ofxOscilloscope.git
git clone git@github.com:produceconsumerobot/ofxThreadedLogger.git
git clone git@github.com:smukkejohan/ofxBiquadFilter.git
git clone git@github.com:jeffcrouse/ofxJSON.git
git clone git@github.com:EmotiBit/EmotiBit_XPlat_Utils.git
git clone git@github.com:EmotiBit/ofxLSL.git
git clone git@github.com:bakercp/ofxSerial.git
cd ofxSerial
git checkout stable
cd ..
git clone git@github.com:bakercp/ofxIO.git
cd ofxIO
git checkout stable
cd ..
```

## macOS 
The EmotiBit software can be compiled on macOS using the provided xcode project files. Each EmotiBit software has it's own project file, already setup with all settings required to build the project from source. Users just have to open the project files and build using xcode.

### Building EmotiBitOscilloscope
- EmotiBit Oscilloscope uses external dependencies that are platform (x86 or arm64) specific. The EmotiBitOscilloscope project therefore provides 2 targets, 1 for x86 and another for arm.
- If you are building on a x86 machine, for example on intel macs, please select the target as `EmotiBitOscilloscope-x86_64` under the build schemes.
- If you are building on an arm machine, for example on apple-silicon macs, please select the target as `EmotiBitOscilloscope-arm64` under the build schemes.
- To edit schemes, click on the `build scheme` > `Edit` > choose the correct target to build.
- <details><summary><b>Known EmotiBitDataParser build error fix</b></summary>
  
  - For `EmotiBitDataParser`, if you get an error `ERROR: -NSDocumentRevisionsDebugMode does not exist, try absolute path` when compiling in `debug
    - Choose the `build scheme`.
    - In the `Run` tab, open the `Options` tab
    - unckeck the `Allow debugging when using document Version Browser` checkbox.
    - Try building again.
  </details>

## Developing on Linux
- You will require a version of gcc on your linux machine. Depending on the version, we need to install the appropriate OpenFrameworks code base. You can check the gcc verison on you system using the following command: `gcc --verison`.
- If you do not have gcc installed, you can install it using `sudo apt install gcc`.
- For EmotiBit software development, we have used gcc v6+, which has been tested to run with the OpenFrameworks
- Download and extract the Openframeworks package for the gcc version on your system. [Openframeworks Downloads](https://openframeworks.cc/versions/v0.11.0/)
  - You can use the following command to extract `tar xvzf <filename>`
- Follow the official [openframeworks guide](https://openframeworks.cc/setup/linux-install/) to set things up. Follow the instruction mentioned below during running `install_dependencies.sh`
  - At one point during installation of the dependencies(after you run the shell script `install_dependencies.sh`), a prompt will ask the user to press Y/N to install `Prompt: â€œinstalling OF dependencies with -hwe-18.04 packages, confirm Y/N ?`. Press N. [Link to article](https://forum.openframeworks.cc/t/urgent-installing-libgl1-mesa-dev-hwe-18-04/32345/3)
- At this point, you should have 
  - all the dependencies installed(successfull run of `install_dependencies.sh`)
  - compiled OF (successfull run of `./compileOF.sh`)
  - project Generator set up(successfull run of `./compilePG.sh`)
- Now, we need all the repositories required to build EmotiBit_Oscilloscope. Install all the addons mentioned in the `Requirements` section.
  - You can either download the repositories, or use `git clone <repo name>` to get the  addons. If git is not installed on your system, use `sudo apt install git` to install git.
- You will also require net-tools to run certain commands required by the Oscilloscope. Run `sudo apt install net-tools`
- That's it! You now are ready to run EmotiBit Oscilloscope!
- To run the Oscilloscope, cd to `(OF_ROOT)/addons/ofxEmotiBit/EmotiBitOscilloscope`. Run the command `make Debug` or `make` to create the release executable.
- Note: When trying to run the EmotiBit Oscilloscope, if you get an error with the following message `cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory : liblsl-1.14.0-manylinux2010_x64`, make sure you have the latest master for [ofxLSL](https://github.com/EmotiBit/ofxLSL). The [fix](https://github.com/EmotiBit/ofxLSL/pull/8/files) added the required [shared object file](https://github.com/EmotiBit/ofxLSL/tree/master/libs/labstreaminglayer/lib/linux64).
