# Testing for EmotiBit DataParser
- Each test is added in it's own folder named appropriately after the test.
- Each test must have the following
  - A `README.md` that defines the test
  - A `run_test.sh` script that runs the test
  - Any additonal data, files, or scripts that are used to create the test or perform the test.

## Sample Data
- Sample EmotiBit data has been provided in the `sample_data` folder. Users can use that data for their specific tests.
- Sample data can be updated as EmotiBit grows in functionality, for example, when new typetags are added.
